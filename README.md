# Store Item Demand Forecasting

`The task is to forecast the total amount of products sold in every shop for the test set.`

You are given 5 years of store-item sales data, and asked to predict 3 months of sales for 50 different items at 10 different stores.


What's the best way to deal with seasonality? Should stores be modeled separately, or can you pool them together? Does deep learning work better than ARIMA? Can either beat xgboost?
